Dear Professor and TAs, 
I have included the information as much as I can over here.


Where I got the containers from :
I found images on docker hub, some images, I created.
The links for them are given here:
For Hadoop:https://hub.docker.com/r/sequenceiq/hadoop-docker/
For Spark(both master and nodes):https://hub.docker.com/r/ujvalakollipara96/spark1
For Jupyter Notebook:https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/jupyter-base-notebook
For SonarQube:https://hub.docker.com/r/ujvalakollipara96/sonar_scanner1
For the main application:https://hub.docker.com/r/ujvalakollipara96/final1



Here is the Box link for the video:

To run the application in the cloud shell, we need to enter the following command :
kubectl exec -it terminal-74f64f869f-gxtm4 -- python3 mainapp.py

I have put in two screenshots:
- services running 
- workloads runnning

I have also put in the yaml files I used to create the workloads and services
