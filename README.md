Dear Sir
I have attached all the requested outputs for the homework for Docker in the folder : Docker.
Please find below the key for the files: 

Part1 of homework: 
Dockerfile ----> the dockerfile for part1 of the homework
helloworld.py -----> the python file for hello world program
link_to_docker_container ----> I was not sure how to past a link directly in github, so I created this file and pasted the link to my docker container here
Port3000pic----> picture shows that I have set the port to 3000
HelloWorldLogPic -----> I ran it in the GUI, so this is the image of the log that shows Hello World output



Part2 of homework:
JupyterNotebookPic -------> this is the screenshot of the jupyternotebook open on my system from running the microsoft image pulled

Thanks and Regards
Ujvala Kollipara
